# Personal-Contact-Management-System

A **console-based Contact Management System** developed in **Embedded C** as part of the coursework. The project enables users to add, modify, delete, search, save, and load personal contact information efficiently using file handling, structures, unions, and dynamic memory.

## 🎯 Aim and Objectives

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical knowledge of **Embedded C Programming** by designing a system that can:

- Store and manage personal contacts (name, phone, email, address).
- Provide a menu-driven interface for easy navigation.
- Ensure data persistence using file I/O.
- Apply key concepts like structures, unions, and pointers.

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ Add new contacts  
- ✏️ Modify existing contacts  
- ❌ Delete contacts  
- 🔍 Search contacts by name  
- 📃 Display all stored contacts  
- 💾 Save contacts to a file  
- 📂 Load contacts from a file  
- ⛔ Exit the system

## 🧠 C Programming Concepts Applied

- **Structures**: Used to define and store multiple fields for each contact.
- **Unions**: Used to store either home or work addresses efficiently.
- **Pointers**: Used for dynamic memory allocation and linked list operations.
- **File Handling**: To save and load contact data (`contacts.txt`).
